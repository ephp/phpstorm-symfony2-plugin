# PHPStorm Symfony2 Plugins

## Synopsis
This is my personal playground for building Symfony2 plugins for PHPStorm. PHPStorm is an awesome piece of software, crafted by the guys and gals at [Jetbrains](http://www.jetbrains.com). 

At the moment none of the plugins in this repo does work as expected, but this is OK, as long as you do not rely on it.

## Plans
I have great respect for the work of Robert Gr√ºndler, who is working on a bunch of eclipse plugins here on [github using his account pulse00](https://github.com/pulse00/Symfony-2-Eclipse-Plugin). His work may inspire me to create a few implementations in PHPStorm.

Unfortunatly, tha IntellJ API and plugins documentations are way behind the eclipse ecosystem's documentation - which will make it slower anyway.
